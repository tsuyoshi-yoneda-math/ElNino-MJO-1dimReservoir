As shown in 1dimReservoir_ElNino_TYoneda.ipynb, the <b>22-step-ahead prediction 
(25 minus lag3) achieves a PCC of 0.54.</b> This is broadly consistent with the results reported in

Similarly, 1dimReservoir_MJO_TYoneda.ipynb shows that the <b>21-step-ahead prediction 
(23 minus lag2) achieves a PCC of 0.69.</b> This is also consistent with the results of

further illustrating the robustness of the reservoir-computing framework with a data-driven filter.
